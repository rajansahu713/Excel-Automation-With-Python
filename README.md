## 9. Simple Project 1
Task 1: we are going to add two more column in excel spreadsheet **Result** and **Grade**.

> In **Result** column we will put **pass** and **Failed** based on Percentage He/She got.<br>
    1. **Pass**: If percentage is greater than and equal to 40.
    2. **Failed**: If percentage is less than 40

> In **Grade** column we will put **1st class**, **2nd class**, **3rd class** and **Failed** based on Percentage He/She got.
    1. 1st class: If percentage greater than equal to 60.
    2. 2nd class: If percentage greater than equal to 50 but less than 60.
    3. 3rd class: If percentage greater than equal to 40 but less than 50.
    4. Failed: If percentage less than 40.
 
Task 2: After doing the first task we will create multiple sheet in the same excel file base on Grade He/She got

## 10. Simple Project  2
    In this project we are separating the records in different excel spreadsheet for different **Grade**.
    All the task is same as **Simple Project 1** but only differece is that we are putting different **Grade** data in different excel spreadsheet.
